### Project 2: Captain Veggie


#### Problem Statement
- For this project we've created the game Captain Veggie, in which rabbits have invaded the good captain’s
field and so the captain must harvest as many of their vegetables as possible before they are consumed by the
leporine menace. 
- In the game, Captain Veggie should be able to move about the field and attempt to harvest
vegetables by moving on top of them. 
- The captain scores points for each vegetable they harvest. At the same
time, the rabbits should also be randomly hopping about consuming any vegetables they should land on. The
game will continue until all the vegetables have been removed from the field, after which the player’s score
will be displayed to the screen.
